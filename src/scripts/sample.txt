The system is composed of several modules that handle different aspects of the embedding and querying process:

Commands: Handles command-line arguments and subcommands.
Config: Manages configuration settings for embedding requests and database connections.
Constants: Provides constant values used throughout the application.
Embedding: Contains logic for generating embeddings and persisting them to the database.
VectorDB: Handles interactions with the PostgreSQL database for storing and querying vector embeddings.
